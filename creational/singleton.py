# SINGLETON PATTERN
#
# Ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

# The singleton design pattern is used in real-world projects to control access to shared resources, 
# manage state, and coordinate system-wide actions.
#
# Clients (instances) may not even realize that theyâ€™re working with the same object all the time.
#
# Lesson chapter: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton
#
# For this purpose, i'll be using metaclass, knowing that there are other methods for doing this (decorator, base class and so on)
#

''' WARNING: This pattern its a little problematic. It violates some SOLID principles.'''
